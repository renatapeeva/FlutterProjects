This is a basic Flutter application that displays a list of clothing items as cards on the home screen. It includes an AppBar with the student's index number and allows navigation to a details screen for each product, showing its name, image, description and price. The design and layout are simple and straightforward, aimed at demonstrating fundamental Flutter concepts like navigation, layout management and basic UI building. While the app is functional, it is quite basic and lacks advanced features or complex functionality.
